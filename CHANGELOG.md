## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

### Removed

## v0.5.0 — 2026-05-21

### Added

- New `nokkvi <verb>` CLI for scripting and WM hotkeys — 16 verbs covering transport, volume, queue, view-switching, and `love`/`rate` on the currently-playing track.

### Fixed

- Lock, heart, and star outline icons in slot-list rows now darken in lockstep with the row's text when the row is selected (centered, multi-selected, or currently playing) — previously they kept their muted light tint against the light selected-row fill and were hard to read. Most visible on private playlists in the Playlists view, but the heart and star outlines had the same issue under multi-selection (ctrl-click) on every slot-list view.
- Menu text no longer renders blank on systems whose sans-serif font has no Medium weight (e.g. Sway + Intel iGPU; reported by @hollisticated-horse).
